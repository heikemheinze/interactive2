<p>YOUR FEET</p>

<p>

When I cannot look at your face
<br>
<em>I look at your feet.</em>
<br>
Your feet of arched bone,<br>
<em>your hard little feet.</em>
<br>
I know that they support you,<br> 
<em>and that your sweet weight</em>
<br> 
rises upon them.<br> 
<em>Your waist and your breasts,</em>
<br> 
the doubled purple<br> 
<em>of your nipples,</em>
<br> 
the sockets of your eyes<br> 
<em>that have just flown away,</em>
<br> 
your wide fruit mouth,<br> 
<em>your red tresses,</em>
<br> 
my little tower.<br> 
<em>But I love your feet</em>
<br> 
only because they walked<br> 
<em>upon the earth and upon</em>
<br> 
the wind and upon the waters,<br> 
<em>until they found me.</em>
<br>

</p>

<p>
	Pablo Neruda
