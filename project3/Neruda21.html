<p>
your feet
<br>
<p>

When I cannot look at your face<br>
I look at your feet.<br>
Your feet of arched bone,<br>
your hard little feet.<br>
I know that they support you,<br> 
and that your sweet weight<br> 
rises upon them.<br> 
Your waist and your breasts,<br> 
the doubled purple<br> 
of your nipples,<br> 
the sockets of your eyes<br> 
that have just flown away,<br> 
your wide fruit mouth,<br> 
your red tresses,<br> 
my little tower.<br> 
But I love your feet<br> 
only because they walked<br> 
upon the earth and upon<br> 
the wind and upon the waters,<br> 
until they found me.<br>

</p>

<p>
	Pablo Neruda
